##DESCRIPTION## 
Overview
The File Management Tool is a C++ console application designed to demonstrate essential file-handling operations including reading, writing, and appending data to and from text files. Built using core C++ features, the tool is an ideal example for learners, educators, and developers looking to understand how file streams (fstream, ifstream, ofstream) are used in C++ to manage data stored on disk.

This lightweight, easy-to-understand application covers all the fundamental techniques of file input/output (I/O) and serves as a practical resource for integrating file operations into larger software systems.

‚ú® Features
Read from a file: Load and display the contents of a text file line-by-line.

Write to a file: Create a new text file or overwrite an existing one with user-defined data.

Append to a file: Add new content to an existing file without erasing previous data.

Error handling: Built-in checks for file accessibility and proper error messaging for missing or corrupt files.

Console interaction: Simple text-based UI using standard input/output streams for intuitive user interaction.

üí° Use Cases
This tool is ideal for:

Students learning C++ file I/O concepts.

Instructors who want a basic file-handling demo.

Developers building CLI-based file manipulation tools.

Projects requiring text logging, note-taking, or data archiving in files.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
C++ (C++11 and above) ‚Äì Core programming language.

Standard Library (iostream, fstream, string) ‚Äì For stream-based input/output, string handling, and file processing.

üì¶ File Structure

‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp          // Main source file containing application logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         // Project description
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.txt        // Example file for testing (optional)
üöÄ How It Works
The tool offers a simple menu-driven interface where users can choose one of the following operations:

Write to File:

Prompts the user to enter a filename and the content.

Creates or overwrites the specified file.

Saves the input data to the file.

Read from File:

Requests the filename.

Opens and reads the content line-by-line.

Displays the content in the console.

Append to File:

Takes the filename and new content.

Adds the content at the end of the file without modifying existing data.
